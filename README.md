A simple Node.js web app that provides weather information about a given location.

The app is built with Express.js, and fetches [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API's to provide current and daily temperature forecast given a specific address. It was deployed to Heroku.
